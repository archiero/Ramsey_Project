    " * We noticed that the size of the array sent down to the GPU was too large for global memory and could only think of two ways around it\n",
    "    1. Create a device function in cuda that would generate the sub-graphs to check. I couldn't think of a way to do it and neither could Dr. Cook so this idea has been put on hold.\n",
    "    1. Send down the sub-graphs in batches. I.e. the array of sub-graphs needed to check for a 40-vertice big-graph and R(3,10) is 10 times too big to fit. So, we're going to send down one tenth of it, then the next tenth and etc til we check them all. This is very slow compared to what we were doing but some optimization of memory transfer should help."
