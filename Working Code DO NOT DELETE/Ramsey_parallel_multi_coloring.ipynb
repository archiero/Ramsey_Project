    "Compared to the amount of space taken up by the subgraph index array, a coloring takes up minimal space. Also, for R(4,6) and R(5,5), we have plenty of space left on the GPU's global array after sending down the complete subgraph index array. So, we should be able to send down a bunch of colorings in order to perform many independent Markov searches without having to adapt our code significantly. "
